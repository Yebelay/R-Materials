-	Best Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R
- Powerful and makes using R easier
- RStudio can:
  - \textcolor{cyan}{Organize your code, output, and plots}.
  - \textcolor{cyan}{Auto-complete code and highlight syntax}.
  - \textcolor{cyan}{Help view data and objects}.
  - \textcolor{cyan}{Enable easy integration of R code into documents}.
-	\textcolor{orange}{User-friendly interfaces}.

## \textcolor{pink}{Basic Setup}

### \textcolor{blue}{Installing R}

- Visit \textcolor{blue}{https://cran.r-project.org/}
- Or simply google "download R" to find the link to download page.
- Also, check out "Install R" tutorial video by RStudio, Inc.

### \textcolor{blue}{Installing RStudio}

- Visit \textcolor{blue}{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}
- Or simply google "download Rstudio" to find the link to download page.
-	Also, check out "Install RStudio" tutorial video by RStudio, Inc.

### \textcolor{blue}{Choose the version for your computer and follow installation instructions.} 

## \textcolor{pink}{RStudio Overview}

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Rstudio1.png")
```

## \textcolor{pink}{Getting Started}

- RStudio will open with 4 sections (called panes): 

###  Source editor pane
- Write and edit R scripts

### Console pane

- Interactively run R commands

### Environment/history pane

- Environment: view objects in the global environment
- History: search and view command history

### Files/Plots/Packages/Help pane

- Files: navigate directories
- Plots: view generated plots
- Packages: manage installed packages in the library
- Help: view help documentations for any package/function

## \textcolor{pink}{Customization} 

### Panes

- The size and position of panes can be customized. 
- On the top right of each pane, there are buttons to adjust the pane size. 
- Also, place your mouse pointer/cursor on the border line between panes and when the pointer changes its shape, click and drag to adjust the pane size. 
- For more options, go to View > Panes on the menu bar. 
- Alternatively, try Tools > Global Options > Pane Layout.

### Appearances

- The overall appearance can be customized as well. 
- Go to Tools > Global options > Appearnce on the menu bar to change themes, fonts, and more.

## \textcolor{pink}{	What is R package}

- Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format. 
- The directory where packages are stored is called the library. 
- R comes with a standard set of packages. 
- Others are available for download and installation. 
- Once installed, they have to be loaded into the session to be used.

## \textcolor{pink}{Installing and Loading Packages}

### \textcolor{blue}{Installing Packages}

- Option 1: Menu
```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F, out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("option1.png")
```
## \textcolor{pink}{Installing and Loading Packages}

- Option 2: Packages Window
```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F, out.width='40%'}
knitr::include_graphics("option2.png")
```

- Option 3: Code
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("readxl") 
```

### \textcolor{blue}{Loading Packages}

```{r, eval=FALSE}
.libPaths() # get library location
library()   # see all packages installed
search()    # see packages currently loaded
```
 
## \textcolor{pink}{Updating R and RStudio}

### Updating R:

- Go to CRAN and download new version
- More efficient: install "installr" package, load it, and run updateR()
  - Updates R and Optionally updates all packages
  - May be better to do this in basic Rgui
- Version should update automatically in RStudio
  - Check/change R version under Tools>Global Options>R version

### Updating RStudio:

- Go to RStudio and download new version
- Click on Help>Check for Updates, follow menu prompts

## \textcolor{pink}{Functions and Help}

- Information about a function read.table can be accessed by typing the following into the console:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

 help(read.table) # help about function read.table
 ?read.table # same thing
 help.start() # general help
 example("read.table") # show an example of function read.table
```

- Arguments are the inputs to a function. 
- In this case, the only argument to help() is read.table. 
- Help files provide \textcolor{cyan}{documentation on how to use functions and what functions produce}.

## 3. Working with R: Objects and Workspace

- The \textcolor{red}{workspace is a working environment} where R will store and remember user-defined objects: \textcolor{cyan}{vectors, matrices, data frames, lists, functions, variables} etc. 
- At the end of an R session, the user can save an image of the current workspace that is automatically reloaded the next time R is started.
- Except for functions most of \textcolor{cyan}{the user-defined objects are usually referred to as R objects} as a way to designate them. 
- An R object makes it easy for humans to designate its content which could be a \textcolor{cyan}{single numerical value or a large table of data}.

## \textcolor{pink}{Organize with an RStudio project}

* It is a good habit to immediately \textcolor{blue}{create a project for handling the analysis of new data and keep everything together}. 
 
 Create an R project

- \textcolor{blue}{File > New Project and then choose: New Directory> Name for the directory > Click on Create Project}
- For more complex project it may be useful to create sub-directories to contain
data, scripts and other documents separately. 

- Can also type the below function into the Console, but we won't do that in this session.

```{r}
prodigenr::setup_project("C:/Users/yebel/Desktop/LearningR")
```


## \textcolor{pink}{Creating R objects}

- Objects can be created in the form of
   - \textcolor{cyan}{variable <- value}  or \textcolor{cyan}{variable = value} or \textcolor{cyan}{variable -> value}. 
   - Variable names can be \textcolor{cyan}{letters, numbers, and the dot or underline characters} but not dot followed by numbers (\textcolor{red}{.4you is illegal}).
- the symbol \textcolor{blue}{<-} that could be read as \textcolor{blue}{"assign.." or "place into" or "read in"} etc. 

```{r}
A <-"Diabetic" # placed in quotes as diabetic is string.
```

- The standard data objects in R are: **\textcolor{blue}{scalars, vectors, factors, matrices and arrays, lists, and data frames}**.
- Data types assigned to each objects are: **\textcolor{cyan}{logical, numeric, integer, character, complex}.**

## \textcolor{pink}{Vector}

- A set of scalars arranged in a one-dimensional array.
- Data values are all the same mode(data type), but can hold any mode.
   - e.g:(-2, 3.4, 3), (TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), ("blue", "gray", "red")
- Vectors can be created using the following functions:
- `c()` function to combine individual values
   - x <- c(10.4, 5.6, 3.1, 6.4, 21.7)
- `seq()` to create more complex sequences
   - seq(from=1, to=10, by=2) or seq(1,10 ) 
- `rep()` to create replicates of values
   - rep(1:4, times=2, each=2)

## \textcolor{pink}{Some useful functions in vector}

- \textcolor{blue}{class(x):} returns class/type of vector x
- \textcolor{blue}{length(x)}: returns the total number of elements
- \textcolor{blue}{x[length(x)]}: returns last value of vector x 
- \textcolor{blue}{rev(x)}: returns reversed vector
- \textcolor{blue}{sort(x)}: returns sorted vector
- \textcolor{blue}{unique(x)}: returns vector without multiple elements
- \textcolor{blue}{range(x)}: Range of x
- \textcolor{blue}{quantile(x)}: Quantiles of x for the given probabilities
- \textcolor{blue}{which.max(x)}:  index of maximum
- \textcolor{blue}{which.min(x)}:  index of minimum

## \textcolor{pink}{Factors}

- A factor is used to store predefined categorical data
- Can be ordered and unordered
   - e.g. :("yes", "no", "no", "yes", "yes"), ("male", "female", "female", "male")
- Factors can be created using \textcolor{orange}{factor()}:`

```{r}
size <- factor(c("small", "large", "small", "medium"))
```

- The levels of a factor can be displayed using \textcolor{orange}{levels()}

## \textcolor{pink}{Matrix}

- Matrix is a rectangular array arranged in rows and columns. 
- The individual items in a matrix are called its elements or entries. 
- Matrices can be created by:
1. matrix()
2. converting a vector into a matrix
3. binding together vectors
- Matrices can be created using the functions:
   - `matrix()` creates a matrix by specifying rows and columns
   - `dim()` sets dimensions to a vector
   - `cbind` combines columns
   - `rbind` combines rows 

## \textcolor{pink}{Matrix}

 e.g.: 
```{r}
m1<-matrix(data = 1:6, nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
m2<-cbind(1:3,5:7,10:12)
x=1:6
dim(x) <- c(2, 3)
```
- Note: dim() can also be used to retrieve dimensions of an object! 

**Assign names to rows and columns of a matrix**

```{r}
rownames(m1) <- c("A", "B", "C") 
colnames(m1)<- c("a","b")
```

## \textcolor{pink}{Data frames}

- a data set in R is stored a data frame.
- Two-dimensional, arranged in rows and columns created using the function: `data.frame()`
- e.g.
```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(ID = 1:3, Sex = c("F", "F", "M"),
                 Age = c(17, 18,18))
str(df) # `str()` displays internal structure of object
```

- We can enter data directly in to a data frame by using the built-in
data editor. 
- We can access the editor by using either the \textcolor{orange}{edit() or fix()}

## \textcolor{pink}{Data frames}

**commands:**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
 new.data<-data.frame()  # creates an "empty" data frame
 new.data<-edit(new.data) # request the changes or  `fix(new.data)`

```


## \textcolor{pink}{Data frames}

- We'll use the data set called **mydata** to do this exploration. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readr)
mydata <- read_csv("Ethiopia_R_training_edit.csv")
#View(mydata)
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}

colnames(mydata)
head(mydata) # to see 6 lines of data 
tail(mydata, 4) # last four rows
colSums(is.na(mydata)) # to missing data
dim(mydata)
length(mydata)
str(mydata)
summary(mydata)
```

## \textcolor{pink}{Subsetting}

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mydata[] # the whole data frame 
mydata[1, 1] # 1st element in 1st column 
mydata[1, 6] # 1st element in the 6th column 
mydata[, 1] # first column in the data frame 
mydata[1] # first column in the data frame 
mydata[1:3, 3] 
mydata[3, ] # the 3rd row 
mydata[1:6, ] # the 1st to 6th rows
mydata[c(1,4), ] # rows 1 and 4 only 
mydata[c(1,4), c(1,3) ] 
mydata[, -1] # the whole except first column
```

## 4. Reading and Writing data

- Importing data is rather easy in R but that may also depend on the nature of the
data to be imported and from what format. 
- Mostly data are in tabular form such as a spreadsheet or a comma-separated file (.csv).
- Base R has a series of read functions to import tabular data from plain text files with columns delimited by: \textcolor{cyan}{space, tab, comma, with or without a header containing the column names}. 
- With an added package it is also possible to import directly from a \textcolor{cyan}{Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format or other foreign formats from various sources}.

## \textcolor{pink}{Importing from local files}

- In base R the standard commands to read text files are based on the \textcolor{blue}{read.table()} function. 
- The following table lists the collection of the base R **read** functions. 
- For more details use the help command **help(read.table)** that will display help for all.

| Function name| Assumes header|Separator |Decimal | File type |          
|--------------|---------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| read.table() |  No           |  " "     |   .    | .text     |
| read.csv()   |  Yes          |  ","     |   .    | .csv      |
| read.csv2()  |  Yes          |  ";"     |   ,    | .csv      |
| read.delim() |  Yes          |  "tab"   |   .    | .text     |
| read.delim2()|  Yes          |  "tab"   |   ,    | .text     |

Table:  Details of dataset readings

## \textcolor{pink}{Reading raw data from other sources}

### \textcolor{blue}{Import data}

- There are many ways to get data into R and out of R.
- Import text file data using read.table() and comma separated files using `read.csv()` functions.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
-# syntax: 
  read.table("file name with full path", arguments)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Examples:# Creates a data frame named myData
  mydata<- read.table(file = "datafile.txt",sep=" ",
                      header=TRUE)
  mydata<- read.csv(file = "datafile.csv")
```

## \textcolor{pink}{Reading raw data from other sources}

- File names are specified in the same way as `file.choose()` function can be used to select the
file interactively.
i.e.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
mydata <-read.csv(file.choose(),sep=",",header=T)
```

### \textcolor{blue}{Useful arguments}

- Check these arguments carefully when you load your data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
myData<-read.csv(file="datafile.csv",header= TRUE,
sep=",", strip.white =TRUE, na.strings= " ")
```

## \textcolor{pink}{Reading raw data from other sources}

- You can reduce possible errors when loading a data file
- The \textcolor{cyan}{header = TRUE} argument tells R that the first row of your file contains the variable names
- The \textcolor{cyan}{sep =  ","} argument tells R that fields are separated by comma
- The \textcolor{cyan}{strip.white = TRUE} argument removes white space before or after factors that has been mistakenly inserted during data entry. 
- The \textcolor{cyan}{na.strings = " "} argument replaces empty cells by NA (missing data in R)

## \textcolor{pink}{Read data}

**Stata to R:** Different packages for stata version >=13 vs. <13

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(foreign) # Versions before stata 13
data <-  read.dta(file="XXX.dta") # Other options
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readstata13) # Versions from stata 13
data <-  read.dta13(file="XXX.dta") # Other options
```

**Excel to R:** There are several packages

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readxl)
data <-  read_xlsx(path="XXX.xlsx", sheet = 1,
col_names = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readr)
data <- read_csv("D:/CDC Internship/R Training/Ethiopia_R_training_edit.csv")
View(data)
```

## \textcolor{pink}{Read data}

**CSV to R:** There are several packages

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readr)
data <- read_csv(file="XXX.csv")
```

**Text file to R:** Available in R base, used for text and csv files 

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data <- read.table(file="XXX.txt",header=TRUE,
                         sep="")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data <- read.table(file="XXX.csv",header=TRUE,
                         sep=",")
```

## \textcolor{pink}{Exporting Data}

**R to Stata:** Use the libraries haven or readstata13

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
write.dta(data,file="XXX.dta")# Other options
save.dta13(data, file="XXX.dta") # Other options
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(haven) # Example to write out text data file 
write.dta(data, "D:/CDC Internship/R Training/Session 1/data1.dta")
```

**R to Excel:** Note the package readxl does not work here

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(xlsReadWrite)
write.xls(data,"data.xls")# Other options
```

**R to csv:** Use readr package

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
write_csv(data, "data.csv", na = "")
```

**R to a text file:**

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
write.table(data, "data.txt", sep="\t")
```
