# R-Materials

Install R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network. I highly recommend you install a precompiled binary distribution for your operating system – use the links up at the top of the CRAN page linked above!

Install RStudio’s IDE (stands for integrated development environment), a powerful user interface for R. Get the Open Source Edition of RStudio Desktop.
